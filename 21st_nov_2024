L aaj dhakka diya K ko, mummy aur wife dono the wahan pe
mummy wife ko boli ki usko samjhna hoga wo ab 2 saal ho gya hai, usko ab samjh mein aa rha hai aur smjh sakta
aur L dhakka dene k baad bola galti se, to mummy(ko laga) boli ki wo jhooth bolna bhi seekh gya hai

wife mummy ko kuch jawab di wapas ki wo jhoth nhi bol rha hai, but mom didn't agreed
mom felt bad, wife also felt bad and wife said to mom ki aap bolti hai ki daanton nhi isko pyaar se batao kabhi kuch aur to kab kya karna hai yeh clear nhi hai

now the thing is everytime L has pushed K, everyone tells that he did it by mistake, that's what he has been hearing from many months so L said the same thing after he pushed K
L doesn't know the concept of lies(jhooth)
