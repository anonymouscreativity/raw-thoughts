- brother, his wife and mom went to market to buy some stuff and didn't ask my wife to come with them(wife's version). - `evening 4-5pm`
- kid kept crying as he also wanted to go with them. he is too small to understand, and wife was also unhappy that nobody asked her to come.
- she called me saying that kid is crying and wanted to go. I came and we got ready and went to mall, wife called brother informing that we are going to mall and they can come there.
- we ordered something to eat and brother came to there at the same time. he ordered few things and we ordered few things and had dinner there itself.
- kid was running around in the mall and wanted to touch and get everything he got attracted to. we want to go home as he wasn't keeping calm and crying too much.
- wife called brother that we should leave, he said asked to wait sometime but me n wife wanted to go home as kid was crying continously.I called brother and told that we are taking auto to home, he got angry at me on the phone for not waiting for them or going with them.
- we took an auto and reached home.
- I kept silent through the night after coming home, wife kept asking me whether I was angry and i said no because I wasn't angry but definitely pensive & sad about whatever happened from evening till night.
- I didn't want to go to mall in first place and asked her we could rather go for a walk or park, but she insisted on going to mall instead stating that I would have gone to mall if brother would asked me to go.

- 6th morning, wife told that mom isn't happy about whatever happened last night and she isn't talking or responding to her.
- this made me think because I don't like anyone getting angry or anyone trying to ignore the other person.
- I woke up and saw mom face and realized something is not right, don't know the exact reason but that's the assumption.
- I kept thinking about it almost half day in sad and pensive state of mood(while still working and taking office calls), neither I asked her nor my wife asked about it.
- in the afternoon almost 3.30pm I spoke to her about another kid in the house and I asked whether she has her lunch.
- writing this entire chain of events has calmed down my monkey brain whether radom trail of thoughts was wandering.
