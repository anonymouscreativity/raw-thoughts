- brother, his wife and mom went to market to buy some stuff and didn't ask my wife to come with them(wife's version). - `evening 4-5pm`
- kid kept crying as he also wanted to go with them. he is too small to understand, and wife was also unhappy that nobody asked her to come.
- she called me saying that kid is crying and wanted to go. I came and we got ready and went to mall, wife called brother informing that we are going to mall and they can come there.
- we ordered something to eat and brother came to there at the same time. he ordered few things and we ordered few things and had dinner there itself.
- kid was running around in the mall and wanted to touch and get everything he got attracted to. we want to go home as he wasn't keeping calm and crying too much.
- wife called brother that we should leave, he said asked to wait sometime but me n wife wanted to go home as kid was crying continously.I called brother and told that we are taiking auto to home.
